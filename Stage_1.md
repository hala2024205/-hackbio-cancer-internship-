**Introduction:**

Visualization of complex biological data remains a challenge in medical research. With accumulation of large volumes of data, it has become imperative to use absolutely accurate tools which can not only manage these datasets but also provide valuable information to interpret these outcomes. Most of the visualization tools require users to implement programming code to function or need paid licenses to access advanced features. In both cases, this might be challenging to a user. However, in this study we discuss SRplot (Scientific and Research plot tool) which is not only a freely available visualization tool but it was primarily developed considering biomedical research problems in mind, offering an intuitive and user-friendly platform. 

**Results:**

SRplot is able to display results in 120 different functions which covers a variety of medical research disciplines like, genomics, population genetics and network data analysis etc. All these different functions allow the SRplot to create a broad range of visualization graphs like bar plot, genome plot and heatmap etc. In addition to visualization, the users can also publish these graphs in their journal.

**Methods:**

Python and R are used to code for the 120 function in SRplot and these plots are constantly updated on the backend. Further, few of the publicly available databases are also linked with SRplot which increases its functionality.

As seen in Fig 1, the user enters the input data for each plot in a document and copy/paste that information on SRplot input box. Then the user makes changes in certain settings like plot name, font size and colors etc and then submit the data for the plots to be generated in real-time. 

Using the high-performance cluster (hpc), the resulting plots are generated as hpc offers multiple CPU cores which allows the output to be faster. Once satisfied, the user can export the output as high-resolution in various formats.

**Discussions:**

SRplot addresses challenges in data visualization in life sciences research. By integrating commonly used functions into a single and freely accessible web tool, it allowed users to  generate customizable, publication-quality graphs quickly, eliminating the need for multiple tools and learning hard and complex coding lanugage. 

**Limitations**:

Currently, SRplot does not support high-dimensional data due to performance limitations. Users may also need external tools like Inkscape for advanced editing. SRplot is not open-source but freely available to non-commercial users. Future updates will enhance functionality based on user feedback, including more data analysis features.
