This is the task

### Objective: 
In this task, you will work in teams — 2 AMR epidemiologist and 4 front-end bioinformaticians — to improve the visualization and reporting of cholera outbreak data from the World Health Organization (WHO). Your goal is to create an intuitive and interactive Shiny app that visualizes the cholera outbreak data and provides insightful summaries and reports for any selected country.

 Form a Team:
 Form a team consisting of 2 epidemiologist and 4 front-end bioinformatician.

 ### Download Raw Cholera Outbreak Data:
 Go to the WHO website (https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.174?lang=en) and download the raw cholera outbreak data.

 ### Innovative Visualization and Reporting (Epidemiologist):
 Analyze the downloaded data and think of innovative ways to report and visualize cholera outbreaks since 1949.
 Identify key trends, patterns, and significant outbreaks.
 Design visualizations that can effectively communicate the severity, spread, and impact of cholera outbreaks.
 Develop a half-page summary template for reporting cholera outbreak data for any country, including key metrics and trends.

 ### Develop a Shiny App (Front-End Bioinformatician):
 Using the R Shiny framework, develop an interactive dashboard to visualize the cholera outbreak data presented by your AMR epidemiologists.
 The dashboard should include features such as:
 Interactive maps and charts.
 Filters for selecting specific countries and time periods.
 Calculations and summaries of key metrics (e.g., total cases, fatalities, outbreak durations).
 Implement functionality  to automatically generate country-specific reports based on the epidemiologist's summary template.
