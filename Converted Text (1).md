Data visualization 

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps  , Depending on the demands of the data and the insights being sought, there are numerous styles of data visualization, such as bie and bar charts.(1)

Data visualization technologies convert large datasets into easily interpreted visual formats, making complex data easier to understand. They facilitate faster decision-making by improving the understanding of data. They also help with trend and pattern recognition, which is important for strategic planning and predictive analytics. Presentation and communication are improved by visual data displays, especially in commercial contexts. (2) 

. One of the important fields of cancer research generates complex data which are genetic sequences, patients’ demographics and clinical outcome data. Thus, the need for some high-end analytical tools arises. When these datasets are represented using visual images, data trends, patterns and relations become clearer. Furthermore, data visualization helps achieve better cancer prognosis and diagnosis. Cancer outcomes and disease progression, among other factors such as treatment and genetic changes, can be understood and projected by clinicians using tools like Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models empathically  (3)

One notable example of data visualization in cancer research is the use of interactive genomic visualization platforms to explore and analyze cancer mutations is  cBioPortal, a widely-used tool for cancer genomics A freely accessible platform for examining genomic cancer data, offers clinical, expression, and genetic change information. Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre used cBioPortal to investigate the genetic alterations linked to lung cancer. They provide maps of mutation frequency and distribution that can be connected to clinical features through comparisons, reassembling data from several investigations. Additionally, they have dissected various survival curves based on specific genetic modifications and patient progression-free survival. As a result, this facilitated the development of customised treatment plans that would enhance knowledge of cancer biology and result in better therapy alternatives. (4)
