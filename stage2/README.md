# HackBio_stage_2
This a teamwork project for stage two focused on frontend bioinformatics

Here we built a shinny.io app that could do some laboratory reagent calculations

Here is the task

## Objective
In this stage, you will enhance your skills as a front-end bioinformatician by developing an R Shiny dashboard designed to assist laboratory scientists with common reagent preparation calculations. Your dashboard should provide user-friendly tools for tasks such as calculating the volumes required for serial dilutions and dilutions of stock solutions. The goal is to create a practical and intuitive application that can be used by researchers in the lab to streamline their daily tasks.
Work in a team of 5 (build your team on #transfer-market, you know the drill)
### Dashboard development:
Design and implement an R Shiny dashboard that performs a variety of common laboratory calculations related to reagent preparation.
Include at least two key calculation modules: one for serial dilutions and another for diluting stock solutions. Think of 2 more scientific procedures you usually do in the laboratory that can be added to this dashboard. Be Innovative!
Inspiration: Sigma Calculators & Apps
Implementing Calculation Logic:
For the Serial Dilution Calculator, implement the logic to calculate the volume of the stock solution to transfer at each dilution step, given the initial concentration, desired final concentration, dilution factor, and total volume.
For the Stock Solution Dilution Calculator, implement the logic to calculate the volume of the stock solution required to achieve a specific final concentration and volume.
Visuals (optional):
Try to add visuals or schematics that helps the user to understand the expected inputs and interpret the way the output should be used
These visuals can also be interactive.
Be innovative
### Reporting
Write a user guide that explains how to use each calculator, with step-by-step instructions and examples.
Provide detailed documentation of the underlying mathematical formulas and the logic used to implement them in R Shiny.
Host the R Shiny dashboard on a server (e.g., shinyapps.io) and provide the URL for access.
Goodluck
